# Contributing to CMCS

Thank you for considering contributing!

## Development setup
- Install .NET SDK 8.0
- Restore and build the solution:
  - dotnet restore
  - dotnet build
- Run the app: dotnet run --project CMCS.Web

## Branching & PRs
- Use feature branches: eat/..., ix/..., chore/...
- Open PRs to master with a clear description and screenshots if UI changes

## Commits
- Use conventional commits, e.g. eat: ..., ix: ..., docs: ..., chore: ...
- Keep commits small and focused

## Code style
- Prefer clear, readable code and small functions
- Avoid unnecessary comments; explain the "why" when needed

## Testing
- No tests yet; consider adding unit tests in a future iteration
